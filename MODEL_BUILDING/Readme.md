 For the project that the poultry disease  based on the transfered deep learning and CNN
 In the  this model building  our team followed  the different various  imported  models that used in the poultry classification.
 In this folder we can provide the various models that included the evaluation . we have the jupyter and keras files combined 

How to Run the Application
Clone or download the repository.
Make sure Python and required libraries are installed (TensorFlow, Flask, etc.).
Place your test images in a folder (or use upload in the UI).
